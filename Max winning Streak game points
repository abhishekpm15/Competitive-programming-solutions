Alok is playing N round of card games with his friend Brinda. He gets positive or negative points based on whether he won or lost in a specific round. Alok can also get zero points in case of a tie.


Given the points obtained in N rounds, the program must print the maximum sum of points obtained in any of the winning streak sequence.


Input:

7

9 2 3 -1 1 2 4


Output:

14


CODE:


#include<stdio.h>

#include<stdlib.h>


int main()

{

int N;

scanf("%d", &N);

int array[N];

for(int i = 0; i < N ; i++){

    scanf("%d", &array[i]);

}

int sum=0;

int max=0;

for(int i = 0; i<N; i++){

    if( array[i] >= 0){

        sum += array[i];

    }

    else{

        if(sum > max){

            max=sum;

        }

        sum=0;

    }

}

if(max < sum){

    max=sum;

}

printf("%d", max);

}

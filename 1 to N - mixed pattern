The program must accept a number N and print the numbers from 1 to N with the first number being 1, second number being N, third being 2 and fourth being N-1 and so on.


CODE:


#include<stdio.h>

#include<stdlib.h>


int main()

{

int N;

scanf("%d",&N);

int last=N;

int i=1;

int count=0;

while(count<N){

    printf("%d ",i++);

    count++;

    if(count<N){

    printf("%d ",last--);

    count++;

    }

}

}
